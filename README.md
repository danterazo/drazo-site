# drazo-site
Welcome to the repo for my [personal website][website_url]! I wrote it in vanilla HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

## Future
- Complete rewrite
  - Tech stack
    - ReactJS
    - TypeScript (TSX)
    - Sass (SCSS)
  - Goals
    - Modularity
    - Easy to update
    - Better visuals / presentation
    - More in-line with [LinkedIn][linkedin_url] profile, which I consider to be my most up-to-date body-of-work.

I plan to rewrite this in ReactJS, TypeScript, and SCSS soon. Stay tuned!
